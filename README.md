## About

Automatically mutes and unmutes Discord while playing Among Us. Uses Discord's "Push to Mute" keybind to silence your microphone during gameplay and unmutes when events occur such as a meeting being called or the game ending. Also includes death detection, so that you will remain quiet in the unfortunate circumstance that you have fallen victim to an imposter.
